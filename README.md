> Future work on the dialog plugin is being done on the v2.x branch. Please submit all bug fixes and features there. Note that the new branch has a set of breaking changes which are designed to enable dialogs to work better with recent enhancements in the templating engine and in bundler support. Several breaking changes are focused around architectural improvements as well. Please expect the shelf-life of v1.x to be relatively short in light of the v2.x work that is currently underway.
